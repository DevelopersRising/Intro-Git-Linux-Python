# meetup_180817

The Repository contains two main files **FreeCodeCamp_presentation.ipynb** and **Tutorial.ipynb** which I used to deilver the talk and tutorial on the **Friday 18th Aug 2017** meetup.

If you wonder what the **ipynb** extentions exists for, it is, **ipy**thon **n**ote**b**ook.

They have been created by an open-source web application called **Jupyter** (http://jupyter.org/).

If you have any questions or suggestions please feel free to contact me.
